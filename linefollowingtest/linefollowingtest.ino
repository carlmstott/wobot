/*
 * Energia Robot Library for Texas Instruments' Robot System Learning Kit (RSLK)
 * Line Following Example
 *
 * Summary:
 * This example has the TI Robotic System Learning Kit (TI RSLK) follow a line
 * using a basic line following algorithm. This example works on a dark floor with
 * a white line or a light floor with a dark line. The robot first needs to be calibrated
 * Then place the robot on the hit the left button again to begin the line following.
 *
 * How to run:
 * 1) Push left button on Launchpad to have the robot perform calibration.
 * 2) Robot will drive forwards and backwards by a predefined distance.
 * 3) Place the robot center on the line you want it to follow.
 * 4) Push left button again to have the robot begin to follow the line.
 *
 * Parts Info:
 * o Black eletrical tape or white electrical tape. Masking tape does not work well
 *   with IR sensors.
 *

  /* For lab 3 you will need to develop a state machine which can accomplish the following task. 
   *  
   *      Your robot will need to navigate from the back wall of the 
   *      competition board (starting on the line facing forward) to right hash on the line closest to the basket. 
   *      A clear picture of this is shown in the Lab 3 Document. 
   *      
   *      Some things to keep in mind:
   *        -How will you know when an intersection has been reached?
   *        -Does linePos tell you all the information you need or will you need the analog data from individual sensors?
   *        -How do you deal with finding the rising edge of an intersection. Falling edge? 
   *
